# HoneyPot image
All-in-one HoneyPot image based on Ubuntu.

## Why ?
Yes, I know, one service one container, but... Too many effort to maintain all images.
I'm doing this image because I need to collect ip addresses from spammers, scammers, intruders and all others rats who haunt the web.

# WIP! YHBW!
ATTENTION! Work in progress, this image can eat your keyboard, dont't use it until i delete this message
